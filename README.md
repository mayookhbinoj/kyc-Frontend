Frontend Application
Project Overview
This repository contains the frontend for a web application developed with React.js, TypeScript, and Vite. The application incorporates modern development practices and technologies, including Redux Toolkit for state management, TailwindCSS for styling, and Axios for handling API requests. The application is designed to be highly performant, modular, and scalable, while ensuring a smooth user experience with minimal configuration.

Key Features:
State Management: Managed globally using Redux Toolkit along with redux-persist for persistent state.
Form Handling: Integrated form management with Formik for seamless user input handling and validation.
Routing: Navigation through the application is handled by React Router DOM.
API Communication: Axios is utilized to handle HTTP requests to backend services.
Styling: A utility-first design approach with TailwindCSS ensures a responsive, modern UI.
Notifications: Toast notifications via React Hot Toast and SweetAlert2 for elegant alert dialogs.
Type Safety: Full TypeScript integration ensures that the application is type-safe and maintainable.
Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js: Ensure that Node.js (version 18.x or higher) is installed.
npm: npm should be available as the package manager. Alternatively, you can use yarn.
Installation Steps
Clone the Repository: First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:


git clone <repository-url>
cd frontend



npm install




Development Server: After installation, run the following command to start the development server:


npm run dev

The application will be available at http://localhost:5173.

Build for Production: To create a production-ready build of the application, use:

Assumptions:
Global State Management: The decision to use Redux Toolkit with redux-persist was made to ensure that the applicationâ€™s state can be managed efficiently and remains persistent across page reloads.
TypeScript: TypeScript is used to provide static typing, which improves the maintainability and scalability of the codebase, especially in larger applications. It also ensures better tooling support during development.
Form Handling: Formik is leveraged for managing form state and validation, which simplifies complex form handling and improves consistency across the app.
Styling Framework: TailwindCSS is used for its utility-first approach, which accelerates development while ensuring responsiveness and a modern UI design.
Trade-offs:
Bundle Size: While tools like Formik and Redux Toolkit offer robust solutions, they add to the bundle size. This trade-off was made for the sake of simplifying application logic and improving developer experience.
Learning Curve: The integration of tools such as Redux Toolkit, Formik, and TypeScript may introduce a slight learning curve for developers who are new to these technologies. However, the benefits in terms of code clarity, maintainability, and scalability justify their inclusion.
Third-Party Libraries: Some third-party libraries, such as SweetAlert2 and React Hot Toast, were added to improve the user experience with minimal custom implementation.
Technologies Used
React.js: A popular library for building dynamic user interfaces.
Redux Toolkit: A toolset that simplifies state management in React applications.
TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds type safety.
TailwindCSS: A utility-first CSS framework for building responsive, modern user interfaces.
Formik: A library that helps with form handling, validation, and submission.
Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
React Router DOM: A declarative routing solution for React applications.
SweetAlert2: A library for beautiful, customizable alert dialogs.
React Hot Toast: A lightweight library for toast notifications.
